tracking_opencv
===============

Small API for visual tracking for testing different tracking techniques. Based on OpenCV 3.0 and intended to be contributed in future.

This work includes (or will) implementations of:

- Mean shift (just a wrapper: opencv meanShift function)
- "Spatiograms Versus Histograms for Region-Based Tracking" by S. Birchfield and S. Rangajaran.
- A particle filter tracker based on the lectures of Desire Sidibe in the Master in Computer Vision at the University of Burgundy.
